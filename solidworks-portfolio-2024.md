# Introduction
Welcome to my professional portfolio showcasing my experience with 3D CAD software. My experience includes solid modeling and engineering drawing creation in SOLIDWORKS and Fusion360.
With a background in electrical engineering, I have used SOLIDWORKS to model a variety of parts and assemblies supporting professional, club, academic, and personal projects. My experience includes design of the following:
- Actuators, bearings, pivots, platforms, motor mounts, clamps, and sensor mounts for moving or rotating assemblies
- Prototypes, conceptual models, and mockups of orthopedic fracture fixation systems and catheter-based medical devices specifically for patent filings
- Stands, mounts, and fixtures for controlled tests including antenna test fixtures
- Boxes, enclosures, cabinets, and panels for electronics housings and speaker cabinets
- Waterproof and sealing assemblies including travel cases and medical device equipment enclosures
- Fittings, ductwork, and mounts for blowers and fans

# Certifications
I have obtained the following CAD certifications:
## CSWA (Certified SOLIDWORKS Associate)
![CSWA certificate issued to Alex Neiman](https://github.com/neiman3/portfolio-images/blob/c5ffe8c8dfc4957241d76ea3cde77cfaa2c5f0a9/images/cert/alexander-neiman-cswa-cert.jpg)
I completed the official Certified SOLIDWORKS Associate (CSWA) exam through SOLIDWORKS. You can view my certificate here: [Official Certificate - Certified SOLIDWORKS Associate (CSWA)](https://cv.virtualtester.com/qr/?b=SLDWRKS&i=C-SP7NYE95BF)
## Other trainings
I have also completed the CSWP Prep training course through SolidProfessor. You can view my certificate here: [SolidProfessor Certificate - Certified SOLIDWORKS Professional (CSWP) Prep](https://plt.solidprofessor.com/certificates/9f8f22dc-9425-4219-9449-2603a5e4146f)


# Design for manufacture
My designs are typically part of a rapid prototyping process, and I am usually the one fabricating the parts. I have experience with designing parts for manufacture with the following processes:
- FDM additive manufacturing (thermoplastic filament 3D printer)
- SLA additive manufacturing (resin 3D printer)
- Sheet metal
- Lathe (Acetal and aluminum only)
- Mill (Acetal and aluminum only)
- CNC (Acetal, nylon, wood, and aluminum)
- Wood tools (hand and power woodworking, cabinetry processes)
- Laser cutter (acryllic)
